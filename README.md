# Google Books Search

This app uses a React front end to search the Google Books API.  The Node backend uses Express routing and the Mongoose ORM to store users' chosen books in a Mongo database.  Once stored, the books can be deleted.

The app is very rough at the moment; only some Bootstrap styling has been applied, and there is currently no feedback on save or delete operations.
I will be cleaning these issues up soon.
