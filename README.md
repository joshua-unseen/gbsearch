# Google Books Search

This app uses a React front end to search the Google Books API.  The Node backend uses Express routing and the Mongoose ORM to store users' chosen books in a Mongo database.  Once stored, the books can be deleted.

The app uses bootstrap for styling, and updates the UI when a book is stored or deleted.
